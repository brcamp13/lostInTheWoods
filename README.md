## My "Pilot" Android application is based on following ideas: 
#### Sometimes, at least in my experience, you may find yourself walking on a trail system where there is no map to base your journey off of. In this case, it is best to find a way to not get lost. What I do is keep a running tally in my head of the "choice" that I made when I arrived at a situation that I could take a left/right turn, or just continue forward. Then, once I reached the end of my journey, I reversed the order of this running tally and the direction of each entry in this running tally. So say the tally was LRLL. Then the reversed tally to take me home would be RRLR. 
## How this app will assist with this process: 
#### This app will perform as follows: There will be a single activity/screen with a button for left, right, or straight, and a button that says "Take me home". Each time the user encounters a choice in the direction that they will take, they press the button that corresponds to the choice they made. Their choices will be saved. Once they select "Take me home", the directions will be reversed and the order of the list will also be reversed. This list will either be displayed as a scrollable or as a single direction at a time.
